Here’s a complete, production-ready `README.md` you can include in your chatbot project for your team:

# 🤖 Bulipe Tech Chatbot (FastAPI + FAISS)

This is a lightweight, production-ready chatbot backend that answers company service-related queries using a question-answer dataset (`data.xlsx`). It's built with FastAPI, FAISS for similarity search, and `sentence-transformers`.
